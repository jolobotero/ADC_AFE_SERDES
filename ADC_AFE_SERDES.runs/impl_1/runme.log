CRITICAL WARNING: [Netlist 29-180] Cell 'ISERDESE2' is not a supported primitive for zynquplus part: xck26-sfvc784-2LV-c.  5 instances of this cell will be treated as black boxes, not architecture primitives [D:/P_vhdl_Vi/ADC_AFE_SERDES/ADC_AFE_SERDES.srcs/sources_1/new/iserdes_adc.vhd:57]
Resolution: Modify instantiation of primitive to match Xilinx primitive. Please review the guidelines in the Design Methodology Guide UG949 to replace this primitive with a supported primitive.
